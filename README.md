System-specific notes
---------------------
The code was tested in Matlab R2016a or higher versions on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------

Directly run demo.m to reproduce the results on the IndinePine dataset, which exists in the aforementioned paper.

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data, ground truth, and num_class) and tune the parameters.

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
